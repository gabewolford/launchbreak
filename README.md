# &#128640; Launchbreak  &#128752;
Launchbreak is a MERN-stack application for launch lovers and space fanactics. 

Using real-time data from two robust APIs, the idea is that Launchbreak is somewhere you can visit on your lunchbreak (or whenever) and catch up on recent space news and upcoming launches in just a few clicks.

## Installation Instructions
No need to install, as this app is hosted and live on Heroku [HERE](https://launchbreak.herokuapp.com/).

If you'd like to fork the repo, you'll need to set up an `.env` file at the root level that looks like this:

```
PORT='<PORT_FOR_BACKEND_SERVER>'
MONGODBURI='<YOUR_MONGODBURI>'
JWT_SECRET_KEY='<YOUR_JWT_KEY>'
```

Both the [Launch Library API](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/docs/) and [Space News API] are FREE and do not require a key to access. However, the Launch Library is subject to rate limiting of 15 calls per hour for non-authenticated requests. Please use [THIS](https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/docs/) for dev testing by simply removing 'dev' from the App component and all DetailPage components
